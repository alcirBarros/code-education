#  Organizations code examples for the SDK for .NET

## Overview

The examples in this section show how to use the AWS SDK for .NET with AWS Organizations to create and manage organizations policies.

With Organizations, you can consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. You can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization. You can organize those accounts and manage them as a group.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
