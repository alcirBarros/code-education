# Amazon Pinpoint code examples for the SDK for Java

This README discusses how to run and test the AWS SDK for Java (v2) code examples for Amazon Pinpoint.

Amazon Pinpoint is a flexible, scalable marketing communications service that connects you with customers over email, SMS, push notifications, or voice.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
*  We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

The credential provider used in all code examples is ProfileCredentialsProvider. For more information, see [Using credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html).

### Cross-service examples

Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

- [Using AWS Step Functions and the AWS SDK for Java to build workflows that send notifications over multiple channels](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javav2/usecases/workflow_multiple_channels)

## Run the examples
To run these examples, set up your development environment to use Apache Maven or Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html). 

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an Amazon Pinpoint application. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account.

## Tests
⚠️ Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

You can test the Java code examples for Amazon Pinpoint by running a test file named **AmazonPinpointTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can run the JUnit tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is run, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulates real AWS resources and might incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the Amazon Pinpoint JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to run the JUnit tests. For example, you define a table name used for various tests. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define these values to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **appName** - The name of the Amazon Pinpoint application. For example, **TestApp2**.
- **bucket** – The name of an Amazon S3 bucket to use for the **ImportSegments** test.
- **path** – The path where the JSON file is located in the bucket for the **ImportSegments** test. For example, **imports/myjson.json**.
- **roleArn** - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role for the **ImportSegments** test.
- **existingApplicationId** - An existing application Id value used in various tests.
- **userId** - An existing user Id value used in various tests.
- **s3BucketName** - An Amazon S3 bucket that is used in the **ExportEndpoints** test.
- **iamExportRoleArn** - The ARN of an IAM role that grants Amazon Pinpoint write permissions to the S3 bucket and used in the **ExportEndpoints** test.
- **filePath** - The path where the files downloaded from the Amazon S3 bucket are written (for example, C:/AWS/).
- **subject** - The email subject to use in the **SendEmailMessage** test.
- **senderAddress** - The from address. This address has to be verified in Amazon Pinpoint in the region you're using to send email .
- **senderAddress** - The to address. This address has to be verified in Amazon Pinpoint in the region you're using to send email .
- **originationNumber** - The phone number or short code that you specify has to be associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account. For best results, specify long codes in E.164 format (for example, +1-555-555-5654).
- **destinationNumber** - The phone number or short code that you specify has to be associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account. For best results, specify long codes in E.164 format (for example, +1-555-555-5654).
- **destinationNumber1** - A second phone number or short code that you specify has to be associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account. For best results, specify long codes in E.164 format (for example, +1-555-555-5654). 
- **message** - The message to use in the **SendMessage** test. 


###  Sample policy text

For the purpose of the JUnit tests, the **ImportSegments** test uses a JSON file to import segments. You must place this JSON file in the S3 bucket specified in the **bucket** value. Also, this JSON file must be located in the **path** location. The following represents an example myjson.json file that you can use for the **ImportSegments** test.   

	{
   	"ChannelType":"SMS",
   	"Address":"2065550182",
   	"Location":{
      		"Country":"CAN"
   	},
   	"Demographic":{
      	"Platform":"Android",
      	"Make":"LG"
   	},
   	"User":{
      	 "UserId":"example-user-id-1"
   	}
	}{
   	 "ChannelType":"APNS",
   	 "Address":"1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c4d5e6f",
   	 "Location":{
      	"Country":"USA"
   	 },
   	 "Demographic":{
      	"Platform":"iOS",
      	"Make":"Apple"
   	 },
   	 "User":{
        "UserId":"example-user-id-2"
   	}
	}{
   	 "ChannelType":"EMAIL",
   	 "Address":"john.stiles@example.com",
   	 "Location":{
      	 "Country":"USA"
   	  },
   	 "Demographic":{
      	 "Platform":"iOS",
      	 "Make":"Apple"
   	 },
   	 "User":{
      	"UserId":"example-user-id-2"
   	 }
	 }


### Command line
To run the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.
